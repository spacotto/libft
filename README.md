# Libft
Build a comprehensive and reusable C programming library by re-implementing foundational functions, thereby deepening understanding of their mechanics and creating an essential toolkit for future projects.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some fuctions have been changed after passing the Moulinette! They might not be norm-compliant or subject compliant! Never trust other's code blindly!

The original 42 project is divided into 3 parts (2 mandatory and 1 bonus).
1. **Part 1:** Recreate a set of functions from the official C library.
2. **Part 2:** Create a customised set of functions.
3. **Part 3:** Create a set functions designed to introduc you to **linked lists**.

> [!WARNING]
> Some functions are from other project or custom and not originally from the Libft!

| `calloc`      | Allocates a block of memory for an array and initialises all bytes to zero. |

### File Descriptor Functions
These functions write various data types to a specified file descriptor, which can be a file, standard output, or standard error. They are a common way to handle I/O in a modular and consistent manner.
| Function Name   | Description                                                                    |

| `ft_putstr_fd`  | Outputs the string `s` to the specified file descriptor.                       |
| `ft_putendl_fd` | Outputs the string `s` to the specified file descriptor followed by a newline. |
| `ft_putnbr_fd`  | Outputs the integer `n` to the specified file descriptor.                      |

### Linked Lists
These functions are specifically designed to teach you the basics of **linked lists**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. They teach you the creation, deletion, modification, and iteration of individual list nodes (or "links") and the list as a whole. All these functions are based on the same given structure.
| Function Name | Description |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ft_lstnew`       | Creates a new node.                                                                                                                            |
| `ft_lstadd_front` | Adds the node `new` at the beginning of the list.                                                                                              |
| `ft_lstsize`      | Counts the number of nodes in the list.                                                                                                        |
| `ft_lstlast`      | Returns the last node of the list.                                                                                                             |
| `ft_lstadd_back`  | Adds the node `new` at the end of the list.                                                                                                    |
| `ft_lstdelone`    | Takes a node as a parameter and frees its content using the function `del`. Free the node itself, but does NOT free the next node.             |
| `ft_lstclear`     | Deletes and frees the given node and all its successors, using the function `del` and `free(3)`. Finally, set the pointer to the list to NULL. |
| `ft_lstiter`      | Iterates through the list `lst` and applies the function `f` to the content of each node.                                                      |
| `ft_lstmap`       | Iterates through the list `lst`, applies the function `f` to each nodeâ€™s content, and creates a new list as a result.                          |
